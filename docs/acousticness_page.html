        <p>The tallest bar nearing 0.0â€“0.2 indicates that highly electronic/produced songs dominate popular music, like pop, EDM and hip-hop. As for the songs nearing the farther end around 0.8â€“1.0, it shows us that acoustic-driven tracks like: folk, singer-songwriter are less frequently listened to or less popular. Based on these results, it seems that mainstream listeners favor electronic production, while the minority group of  listeners prefer organic/acoustic sounds.
