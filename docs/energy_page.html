        <p>The tallest bars are around 0.6â€“0.8, suggesting that moderate-to-high energy tracks are the most common energy levels in popular songs. Take for example, pop, dance, hip-hop music. This also tells us that lower energy level songs such as: ballads, acoustic, or lo-fi and much higher-energy level songs such as: hyperpop and hardcore EDM, are less popular. </p>
